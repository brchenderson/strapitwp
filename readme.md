#  The Strapit WordPress theme is based on the HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme and the Strapit Framework

## Summary:

The HTML5 Reset WordPress theme is a blank theme based on the [HTML5 Reset templates](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset). It's a great empty slate upon which to build your own HTML5-based WordPress themes.

Strapit, created by the UX Team at Digital First Media, is a framework mashup of Twitter's Bootstrap and ZURB's Foundation.

In addition to all the standard WordPress elements and classes, we have added the code required so that the single post template conforms with the [hNews microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews).

### The Strapit WordPress theme has the following features:

1. Responsive
2. Easy to customize -- remove whatever you don't need, keep what you do.
3. Analytics and jQuery snippets in place
4. Meta tags ready for population
5. Empty mobile and print style sheets, including blocks for device orientation
6. Modernizr.js [http://www.modernizr.com/](http://www.modernizr.com/) enables HTML5 compatibility with IE (and a dozen other great features)
7. iPhone/iPad/iTouch icon snippets 
8. Lots of other keen stuff...
